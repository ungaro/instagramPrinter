# Instagram Printer

This is an instagram photobooth application for a friend's event space.

Given a hashtag:
- it will pull recent tagged media from instagram
- Overlays an Image on top of it
- write some text 
- saves into a folder
- sends it to printer for printing (possibly a polaroid printer)

just rename .env.example file to .env and add required fields.
